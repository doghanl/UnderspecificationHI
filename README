README
This repository provides a neural network (NN)-based method to address under-specification in Health Index (HI)-based Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. The experiments utilize the C-MAPSS dataset.

Files and Functionality
iteration.py: Trains the models to achieve high RUL prediction accuracy.
curveFinding.py: Seeks a low-loss curve connecting two trained models to provide a low-loss area for optimization.
convex(more).pt and convex(less).pt: Two trained samples that can be directly used in curveFinding.py.
RULonly.pt, multi.pt, and cost+RUL.pt: Models trained with RUL loss only, multiple restarts, and a linear combination of RUL loss and cost loss, respectively. These models can be compared with our method.

Requirements
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib


Training Models:
Run iteration.py to train models with high RUL prediction accuracy.

Finding Low-Loss Curves:
Use curveFinding.py to seek a low-loss curve connecting the trained models, providing a low-loss area for optimization.

Comparing Models:
Compare the models RULonly.pt, multi.pt, and cost+RUL.pt with our method using the provided files.
