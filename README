This work provides an NN-based method to address the under-specification in HI-based RUL prediction.
The experiments use the C-MAPSS dataset.

File iteration.py trains the models giving high RUL prediction accuracy and curveFinding.py seeks a low-loss curve connecting 2 trained models to provide a low-loss area for optimizing.
convex(more).pt and convex(less).pt are two trained samples that can be directly used in curveFinding.py
RULonly.pt, multi.pt, and cost+RUL.pt are models trained with RUL loss only, multiple restarts, and a linear combination of RUL loss and cost loss. These models can be compared with our method.

Requirements: pytorch, numpy, matplotlib.
